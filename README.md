# Password-Generator

[Password Generator](https://migsrkrd.github.io/Password-Generator/)

## Description
The Password Generator helps you create a password given specific criteria that it asks you. It asks you how many characters you would like, as well as if there should be any uppercase, lowercase, numbers, or special characters to include. After going through all options, the website will print out your newly generated random password in its display box.

This website works with javascript to collect your inputted data and specifications to create your ideal password. Many people are overwhelmed with the amount of passwords and accounts they have in their life, so if you are looking for an easy and creative way to bypass this problem, this is a perfect fit!

## Usage
To utilize this sight, first load up the page. You will see a large red button at the center of the site. Click it, and you will notice a prompt window appearing at the top of you browser. The prompt should ask you how many characters you would like your password to be. Enter a value anywhere from 8 to 128 to avoid getting an invalid response. Next follow the next few questions and press confirm for yes, and cancel for no. At the end you will be given a randomly generated password that fits your criteria.

## Learning Experiences

I learned a lot during this project. Understanding the scopes and layouts of function was a great addition to my web-developing learning. As well as, javascript formatting with variables and arrays.
